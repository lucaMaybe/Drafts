# The Others

I don’t get the others.  
Sometimes I think I understand people. I don’t.  
Sometimes I think people like me. I can’t really tell.

I see people doing things, and sometimes I do those things myself. Then I wonder: why are we doing these things? Why is no one asking this question?

So, I’ll stay by myself.
