# The Violent Society
Since I was a child, I was taught that the good people won the war, that the bad people were defeated, and that our society would become more prosperous and affluent than ever.
They told me that our society is just because we have a system of laws, a constitution, and that merit would be acknowledged and rewarded.

I’m quite sure that’s the story most Westerners were educated with.
Such a shame, though, that nowadays our society is a messy, fucking disaster—ruined by strange ideas, nonsensical rules, and men of poor judgment telling others what to do. Fine, whatever.

It seems that crime is on the rise, that violence is increasing. That might be true, but even if it is, I don’t care. What do we expect from an unequal society?
Does being poor justify being an asshole or, even worse, a violent criminal? Absolutely not. But what about the rich committing nonviolent crimes?
That argument might sound flawed or biased, and honestly, I don’t care. Instead, let’s talk about a different kind of violence—one embedded in the very kernel of the simulation we’re trapped in.

In the past, people complained about fucking kings and rich nobles taxing the hell out of the poor. In the end, nothing really changed, but wow, what a journey we’ve been through!
The nobility eventually gave us something to play with—what we now call the constitution.
Don’t get me wrong; I’m not some drunk monkey pissing on a decent piece of society. In the end, it’s a good thing. But you see, it’s still just a “thing,” like everything else.

Here’s the kicker: as a reward for being a country “founded on work,” every day in my country, at least one person dies at work.
If you’re a little bit lucky, you can pretend to be free—an “entrepreneur”—even if all you do is sell crap in some stupid shop. To some extent, we’re fortunate that people are stupid enough to pay for whatever bullshit they’re convinced will change their lives.
But if you’re not one of those lucky ones, you’ve got to work, my friend—and that’s where the shit begins.

The firm is a violent institution, formally governed by law and informally by culture, beliefs, and judgments.
Despite our supposed rejection of slavery as an economic system, many people still think it’s fine for young people to work for free because they “don’t have experience.” That’s the first form of violence.

If you’re lucky enough to move past that, you might get a temporary contract. Now you’re part of the “family.” You understand you have to obey because you depend on your wage. And if your boss treats you like shit, you’ll think twice about protesting because you need that fucking wage—and the laws meant to protect you? Not even worth mentioning.

It’s not rocket science. My observations don’t have peer-reviewed studies or p-values to back them up, and I don’t need a fancy definition of violence.
What most people understand, though, is this: one day, they might be the ones living a decent life while everyone else eats shit.
Sometimes, this is called the rat race. I bet you know a few people caught in it.

You spend so much time at work that what you are becomes the sum of those experiences. And guess where you spend most of your time?
Yes—at work. You learn to eat shit and to treat others like shit. Sure, some environments are better than others. If you’re in a good one, consider yourself lucky—or maybe rethink your position in the fucking universe.

In any case, this is where violence originates, spreads through society, and manifests in different forms. Possession is violent. Rules are violent. And guess who makes the rules? The same people who make arrangements for the other poor bastards striving for a living.

That’s it.

So, yes, it turns out the firm scares me more than the street.
