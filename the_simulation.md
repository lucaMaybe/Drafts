# The Simulation
So, there’s this thing called simulation theory, which posits that we’re living in a simulation. Now, that’s tricky to disprove. Some people think it needs to be proven, and they’ll complain that your theory doesn’t sound robust enough. Yet, these same people do stupid things, hold surreal beliefs, and pretend that’s perfectly okay.

In Italy, I used to think that being ruled by unskilled people and pizzaioli was a peculiar trait of our country—maybe even a feature of low-paying jobs. When you’re poor, all kinds of shit happen. It is what it is.

But then I discovered that this phenomenon isn’t limited to Italy. It happens everywhere, at every level.
I was watching a very interesting TV series, The Consultant. A crazy guy offers contracts to troubled entrepreneurs, contracts that will take effect upon their death. These entrepreneurs want to live the myth of capitalism so badly that they arrange their own deaths in exchange for their firms’ survival in the market economy. Huge profits, a legacy—something to be remembered for.

And so, the firms get “renewed” by this mysterious consultant who, hilariously, often knows nothing about what the employees actually do. Or, rather, he needs to know everything about them to manipulate them—he doesn’t need to know the business itself. That’s the fun part of the show if you get it.

After firing some people, management offices become available. And who gets the office?
Merit? Come on. Merit belongs to whoever grabs it. Cue the scene where people are literally fighting for a fucking office.

Now, let’s talk about how we often misunderstand evolutionary theory. We make jokes about it or use it to justify nonsense because we don’t understand theory in general.
I don’t expect everyone to grasp theoretical concepts, and I don’t think people are dumb for struggling with them. But evolution isn’t about rewarding “merit” as we humans define it. Evolution is about fitness—how well something adapts to its environment. It has nothing to do with human notions of fairness or merit. So let’s just walk away from that rubbish and move on.

Back to the simulation. We simulate constantly. We behave differently in different situations, and each scenario is like its own little simulation with conventions you’re not supposed to break—or even mention.

As a result, you end up feeling fucked up. You think you have a problem communicating with others because, apparently, you’re lacking empathy. So what do you do? You go to a therapist and start saying things like, “I have to be good with myself, or I won’t be able to...”

Bullshit. Just be kind anyway and take your time when you need to. You’re a human being—and yes, also an animal. Oh, I get it. We’re supposed to pretend we’re no longer animals. That’s right.
