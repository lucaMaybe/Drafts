### The Lost Revolution

I am writing from a laptop, and sometimes we still use the word “PC.” Maybe you have a Mac, or you’re running Linux. There’s no need to be pedantic here because, at its core, everything started with the idea of the "Personal Computer."

“PC” is a compound word, and the most important part is the first: *personal.* At this point, we need to dig into what *personal* actually means. Yes, it means it’s yours. It’s where you store your files, your emails, maybe even your secrets. (Ok, maybe not anymore—I’m old.) But when the idea of the PC was born, *personal* was supposed to mean something more intimate. It wasn’t just a tool; it was a machine that belonged to you in a fundamental way. You got a manual. You had to learn how it worked. You had to understand your technology to use it. The promise was that this understanding would empower people—a society of informed individuals, fluent in the beauty and dangers of a global, distributed system.

That… didn’t happen.

Maybe for good reason. After all, we can drive cars without knowing how the engine works. This is called abstraction, and computer science is a master of it. But here’s the catch: abstraction lets us use technology without understanding it. You can write code without grasping how the computer runs it (hello, this is me). You can use a phone, laptop, or tablet without the faintest idea of what makes it tick.

As a result, the machine isn’t really *yours.* A private company owns the software. You don’t own the code; you’re just licensing it. Your hardware is useless without the operating system, and if something breaks, the company provides a patch. End of story.

### The Subtle Exchange

In our society, everything is an exchange. When it comes to technology, the exchange is subtle but profound: we’ve traded understanding for convenience. Worse, we’ve traded control for services. What are we selling? Our data.

Today, we have ChatGPT, targeted advertising, a social media economy built entirely on attention, and—let’s face it—ads everywhere. But hey, you don’t need to know anything about computer science to use it all. Is that a win?

The same logic applies to money. It could have been digital and democratized, but we got crypto scams, Bitconnect, and… the Fed. Once again, we’re just users of a system we don’t really understand. And that’s fine, right? We’re managing.

### The Fallout

We lost the PC revolution, the internet revolution, and even the chance to revolutionize money. Productivity is low, inflation is high, and a lot of things seem to be going to shit. But… since we’ve learned to deal with all of this without understanding anything, it’s okay, right?

Yet, we pretend to revolutionize the world by polluting main squares with stupid slogans while blaming bad people on social media.
