# Thirteen Things You Didn’t Know About Labour Productivity
Please, shut up—seriously, I’m tired of hearing you complain about your cocksucker wage. Yes, it’s low. What do you want me to do about it?

Work harder, think smarter, touch some grass, be a man—or a woman. Though honestly, if you’re a woman without a strong passion for photography or feet pics, it might be easier to just pretend you’re a man. Ok, I didn’t say that. But here’s the point: you’re poor, and your wage sucks because you don’t work hard enough. Your colleagues? Same story. Stupid monkeys, all of you. And because of that, the productivity of your firm is low, so now you’re stuck buying groceries at Lidl.

But hey, what is productivity, anyway? It’s simple on paper. Imagine I’m a machine that produces apples. Specifically, I make 12 apples per hour. Nice, right? That’s my productivity.

Now, suppose I need to collaborate with other machines. If you upgrade my software, I’ll manage to produce 16 apples per hour. Amazing. We’re on the fast track to getting rich.

But here’s the catch: I’m not a machine. I’m an animal—a civilized one, sure, but still an animal. So, when I start working, I’m lazy. Then I get tired. If I keep pushing myself, I’ll get injured, and then my life is screwed.

Economics, the so-called bible of Western society, loves to simplify this nonsense. They average productivity and act like it’s all theoretical—just playing with Greek symbols to sound smart. Who cares if humans get tired, right? It’s just an example for the textbooks.

But this bullshit gains traction when people use it to explain why wages in Italy are so low. Of course, we’re labeled lazy. And don’t even mention the young workers! 
They expect wages even during stage! You understand the peril of inflation? Having ultra-rich kids spending all their money on their cats. We just cannot afford this.
So, what can we do?

Next time you read an article blaming low wages on low productivity, ask yourself this: Why is productivity low in the first place?
Do you make decisions? Are you the person in the black jacket telling everyone else what to do? Are you the one investing in human resources, technology, safer environments, or anything like that?

No? So you do not organize work?

Then it’s not your fault. You’re doing what you’re told for a ridiculous wage. That’s all.

But here’s the kicker: no one will ever blame management for low productivity Instead, they’ll tell politicians to make labor more “flexible.” Yeah, flexible. You know what we should flex? The fucks we give.
As a matter of fact, measuring management productivity leads to even more dramatic result. But do not be afraid my friend, market forces will make it up.
