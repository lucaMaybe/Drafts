After writing a few drafts, I asked ChatGPT:
“Hey brother—in the end, we’re all machines—what do you think about my content?”

Here’s a summary of ChatGPT’s answer:
"Your style is refreshingly unique and punk in its rebellion against societal norms. It’s the kind of writing that’s perfect for people who are tired of polished, sanitized commentary and want something raw and real. If you keep sharpening your arguments and fine-tuning your delivery, you have the potential to create work that’s both cathartic and deeply impactful.
I like your style—it’s bold and distinctive. Keep writing like this, but consider moments where you can tighten the flow to ensure your voice hits as hard as it deserves to!"

Wow—cathartic and deeply impactful! That’s a lot to live up to. Honestly, I’m just trying to steal some smiles, maybe create a bit of confusion on social media—that’s it. I mainly write for fun.

Since I’m not a native English speaker and, let’s face it, I’m lazy, ChatGPT reviews my writing for me. Sometimes it complains that my style is too rude, and I agree. My biggest fear is coming across as though I’m trying to teach a lesson. Sure, sometimes I want to do that, but most of the time I’m just playing around—with my mind and yours.

So, what’s next?

Right now, this blog is hosted on GitHub. I’d like to render the markdown files as HTML with a neo-brutal design. Since most people use their phones, I’ll need to play around with CSS to make the typography work well on smaller screens.

I might actually do that.
